# Conversation Management & Classification using Groq API

This package contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates:
- Conversation history management with truncation and periodic summarization.
- JSON Schema based information extraction using function-calling style compatible with Groq's OpenAI-compatible API.
- MOCK_MODE to run everything without API keys for demo/testing.
- Instructions to run with real Groq API keys and push to GitHub.

Notes:
- Do NOT commit API keys to public repos. Use Colab environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
- The notebook includes a template for function-calling payloads compatible with OpenAI/Groq.
